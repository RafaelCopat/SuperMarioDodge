## SuperMarioDodge

A game made in C++, using animations,scrolling,collision,layers and the parallax effect.

The goal is to dodge the shells, switching the layer you are at and get to the end of the level.

#####Controls:
```
W - UP
S - DOWN
SPACE - START GAME
R - RESTART GAME
```
The code is not optimized and has leaks of memory because i am not used to program with pointers in C++.
Also, the game don't start very quickly because of the reading of ".ptm" images.
